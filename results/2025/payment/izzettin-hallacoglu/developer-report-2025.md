## 1. Analysis Notes

### Data Collection Results

**GitLab Search:** Completed across all 300+ accessible projects
**Result:** No merge requests found for username `izzettin.hallacoglu`

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **GitLab username mismatch** - Username may be different from expected
2. **No merged MRs** - MRs may have been created but not merged before departure
3. **Project access** - Work may have been in inaccessible private projects
4. **Trial period context** - 2 months may not be enough time to complete and merge MRs
5. **Team lead role focus** - May have focused on code reviews rather than MR authorship

## 2. Context: Trial Period

**Employment Duration:** November 11, 2024 - January 15, 2025 (~2 months)
**Role:** Team Lead (Trial Period)
**Exit Reason:** Trial period concluded, did not continue

### Trial Period Expectations

For a team lead position, the typical 2-month trial period focuses on:
- Team dynamics understanding
- Code review and mentorship
- Sprint planning participation
- Technical decision-making
- Minimal direct coding (MR authorship)

**Note:** Team leads often contribute via code reviews (not captured in MR authorship metrics) rather than creating MRs themselves.

## 3. Recommendations for Future Analysis

### Alternative Data Sources

1. **Code Review Activity:**
   ```bash
   # Check for review activity instead of authorship
   python scripts/gitlab/gitlab_team_lead_analysis.py --username izzettin.hallacoglu --role reviewer
   ```

2. **Jira Activity:**
   ```bash
   # Check for sprint planning, story refinement
   pythonscripts/jira/jira_team_analysis.py --project TPAY --user izzettin.hallacoglu@odeal.com.tr
   ```

3. **GitLab Comments/Notes:**
   - Check merge request comments
   - Issue discussions
   - Code Review feedback

### Data Collection Checklist

- [ ] Verify correct GitLab username
- [ ] Check code review statistics (reviews given)
- [ ] Analyze Jira activity (issues created, commented, assigned)
- [ ] Review Sprint participation (stand-ups, retros - external tool data)
- [ ] Check documentation contributions (wiki, README updates)

## 4. Conclusion

**Status:** Insufficient GitLab data for comprehensive performance assessment.

İzzettin Hallaçoğlu's trial period (Nov 11, 2024 - Jan 15, 2025) concluded without merged MRs in GitLab. For a team lead role, this is not necessarily indicative of poor performance, as team leads prioritize code review, mentorship, and planning activities over direct code authorship.

**Recommended:** Analysis should focus on:
1. Code review contributions (reviews given to team members)
2. Jira activity (sprint planning, story refinement)
3. Team feedback (qualitative assessment from team members)
