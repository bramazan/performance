## 1. Analysis Notes

### Data Collection Results

**GitLab Search:** Completed across all 300+ accessible projects
**Result:** No merge requests found for username `yasir.arslan`

**Context - Normal for Onboarding:**
- **Start Date:** Late December 2025 (~1 month ago)
- **Role:** Stajyer (Intern)
- **Expected Behavior:** First 4-6 weeks typically involve:
  - Environment setup
  - Codebase orientation
  - Documentation reading
  - Shadowing senior developers
  - Small bug fixes (may not be merged yet)

**Possible Reasons for No MRs:**
1. **Early onboarding phase** - Too early to expect completed MRs (1 month is normal)
2. **MRs in review** - May have created MRs that are pending review/merge
3. **Local development focus** - Working on local setup, learning environment
4. **Training assignments** - Internal training tasks (not pushed to GitLab)

## 3. Onboarding Progress Assessment

### Expected Milestones (Based on Start Date: Dec 20)

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| GitLab access & environment setup | Week 1 (Dec 27) | ✅ Complete | Username active |
| First MR created (any status) | Week 4 (Jan 17) | ❓ Unknown | GitLab check needed |
| First MR merged | Week 6 (Jan 31) | ⏳ Pending | Expected this week |
| Weekly MR cadence (1-2/week) | Week 10 (Feb 28) | ⏳ Pending | Target for Feb |

### Recommended Actions (For Team Lead)

**Week 5 Check-in (Now - Jan 26):**
1. ✅ **Verify MR creation:** Check if Yasir has created ANY MRs (merged or not)
   - If no MRs created: Assign first bug fix task
   - If MRs pending review: Prioritize review to boost confidence

2. ✅ **Assign first task:** Simple, well-defined task (4-8h effort)
   - Suggested: Documentation improvement (README, code comments)
   - Alternative: Simple bug fix with clear acceptance criteria
   - Goal: First merged MR by Jan 31 (Week 6)

3. ✅ **Pair programming session:** Schedule 2-3 sessions with Mustafa or Anıl
   - Focus: Git workflow, MR creation, CI/CD basics
   - Duration: 2h each session

4. ✅ **Set expectations:** Communicate internship milestones
   - Week 6: First merged MR
   - Week 10: 1-2 MRs/week rhythm
   - Week 12: Independent small feature work

## 4. Onboarding Best Practices (For Yasir)

### Week 5-6 Goals (Current Phase)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ Create and submit your first MR (if not done yet)
   - Even a small documentation fix counts!
   - Ask for help with Git/GitLab workflow

2. ✅ Request code review pairing with Mustafa or Anıl
   - Watch them review an MR
   - Learn what reviewers look for

3. ✅ Study payment team codebase:
   - Project 430 (payment) - 52% of team's work
   - Project 443 (okc) - Core platform
   - Project 445 (payment-handler) - Business logic

4. ✅ Ask questions early and often:
   - "How do I run tests locally?"
   - "What's the MR approval process?"
   - "Can you walk me through [feature X]?"

### Common Intern Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Don't wait too long to ask for help (>4h stuck = ask)
- ❌ Don't create massive first MR (keep it <100 lines)
- ❌ Don't skip CI/CD checks (always run tests locally first)
- ❌ Don't hesitate to push "work in progress" MRs (use WIP: prefix)

## 8. Conclusion

**Status:** 🌱 **ON TRACK** (Normal onboarding pace for 1-month intern)

Yasir Arslan is in the early onboarding phase (Week 5). Zero MRs after 1 month is normal for an intern. Expected first merged MR by Week 6 (Jan 31). Recommendations focus on assigning first task, scheduling pair programming, and setting clear milestones.

**Assessment Timeline:**
- **Next Review:** February 28, 2026 (Week 10 - Ramp-up check)
- **Formal Evaluation:** June 30, 2026 (6-month intern review)

**Growth Trajectory (Projected):**
- Jan 2026: 0-2 MRs (onboarding)
- Feb-Mar 2026: 3-4 MRs/month (ramp-up)
- Apr-Jun 2026: 5-8 MRs/month (productive)
- Jul 2026: Transition to junior developer (if successful)
