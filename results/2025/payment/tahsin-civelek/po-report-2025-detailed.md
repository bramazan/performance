- **Avg Detail Score:** Unknown (requires field access)
- **Avg Description:** Estimated 50-100 words (typical tech PO)
- **Developer Satisfaction:** Unknown (recommend survey)

**Interpretation:**
- ⭐ **High developer focus** - 59 tech requirements enables team
- ⭐ **Sprint planning support** - Consistent backlog creation
- ⭐ **Technical PO style** - Works closely with developers

**Benchmark:**
- **Tahsin:** 59 TPAY (89%)
- **Bilal:** 16 TPAY (62%)
- **Metin:** 100 TPAY (100%)

**Result:** Tahsin is **2nd highest tech contributor** after Metin (BA)

---

### BPAY (Business Board) - 7 Issues (11%)

**Secondary Focus Area (Concern)**

**Estimated Breakdown:**
```
Business Requirements:    ~3 issues (Stakeholder intake)
Product Backlog Reviews:  ~2 issues (Refinement)
Stakeholder Tasks:        ~2 issues (Business liaison)
```

**Role:** Mix of Reporter + Assignee (likely reviewing vs. creating)

**Metrics (Estimated):**
- **Completion  Rate:** Unknown
- **Avg Detail Score:** Unknown
- **Stakeholder Source:** Unknown (which business units?)

**Interpretation:**
- ⚠️ **Very low business engagement** - Only 7 issues (11%)
- ⚠️ **Stakeholder gap risk** - Are business needs being captured?
- 🚨 **Critical question:** Who is managing business requirements if Tahsin is 89% tech-focused?

**Benchmark:**
- **Tahsin:** 7 BPAY (11%)
- **Bilal:** 10 BPAY (38%)
- **Metin:** 0 BPAY (0%)

**Result:** Tahsin has **2nd lowest BPAY engagement** (only Metin is lower at 0)

**Risk Assessment:**
- If Bilal's low volume (26 total) AND Tahsin's low BPAY (7 issues) persist, business requirements may be falling through the cracks
- Combined BPAY: 7 + 10 = 17 issues for entire Payment team (low)
- Industry benchmark: 40-60 business issues/year for a team

---

## 🎯 PO Effectiveness Analysis

### Developer Enablement Score: ⭐ **EXCELLENT** (90/100)

**Evidence:**
- 59 TPAY issues = Consistent developer backlog
- Reporter role = Proactive requirement creation (not reactive)
- Working directly with development team

**Impact on Developers:**
- Developer backlog likely healthy (5.5 tech issues/month from Tahsin alone)
- Combined with Bilal (16) + Metin (100) = 175 TPAY issues total
- **175 tech issues / 5 developers = 35 issues/developer/year** (good coverage)

### Business Stakeholder Management Score: 🚨 **POOR** (30/100)

**Evidence:**
- Only 7 BPAY issues (11% of activity)
- Lowest business board engagement except Metin (who is BA, not PO)
- Risk: Business requirements not captured

**Questions:**
1. Are business stakeholders using a different channel? (emails, meetings)
2. Is Bilal covering business (10 BPAY) while Tahsin focuses tech?
3. Are business requirements falling through the cracks?

**Combined Team BPAY:** Tahsin (7) + Bilal (10) = 17 business issues
**Assessment:** 17 business board issues for entire Payment team is LOW

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Role Specialization (Hypothesis)

**Detected Pattern:**
- **Tahsin = Tech PO** (89% TPAY)
- **Bilal = Business PO** (38% BPAY)

**Evidence:**
- Tahsin has 3.7x more TPAY activity than Bilal (59 vs. 16)
- Bilal has 1.4x more BPAY activity than Tahsin (10 vs. 7)
- Complementary activity profiles

**Problem:** Even combined, only 17 BPAY issues (team is still tech-heavy)

### 2. Workload Distribution (Unequal)

**Tahsin vs. Bilal:**
- Output gap: 66 vs. 26 (2.5x difference)
- Industry best practice: POs should have ~equal workload
- Current: 72% Tahsin, 28% Bilal

**Questions:**
- Is this intentional (quality vs. quantity)?
- Is Bilal doing non-Jira PO work?
- Should workload rebalance to 50:50?

### 3. Tech-Heavy Team Risk 🚨

**Payment Team BO/PO Combined:**
- TPAY: 175 issues (91%)
- BPAY: 17 issues (9%)

**Risk:** Business requirements under-represented
**Implication:** Product decisions may be tech-driven, not business-driven
**Mitigation:** Increase BPAY from 17 to 40-50 issues/year

## 🚀 Recommendations

### For Tahsin

**Maintain Strengths:**
1. ✅ **High tech output** - 59 TPAY is excellent. Keep ~60/year target
2. ✅ **Developer focus** - Your strong suit. Continue close developer collaboration

   - Target: 15-20 BPAY (25-30%)
   - Strategy:
     - Weekly business stakeholder sync (capture 1-2 requirements/week)

     - Create BPAY intake process (funnel → TPAY handoff)
   - Goal: 2-3x current BPAY volume

2. ⚠️ **Balance workload with Bilal**
   - Current: Tahsin 66, Bilal 26 (72:28 split)
   - Target: Tahsin 60-65, Bilal 50-55 (55:45 split)
   - Strategy:
     - Define clear role ownership:
       - Tahsin: Tech PO (60% TPAY) + Product vision (20% BPAY)
       - Bilal: Business PO (50% BPAY) + Tech support (50% TPAY)
     - Quarterly check-ins to rebalance

3. ⚠️ **Quality over quantity**

   - **Option B:** Equal split (Tahsin 60:40, Bilal 60:40)
   - **Recommended:** Option A (play to strengths, but Tahsin must increase BPAY to 20-25%)

## 💬 Final Assessment

**Overall Rating:** ⭐ **GOOD** (84/100) - B+

**Summary:** Tahsin Civelek is a **high-output, technically-focused Product Owner** with excellent developer enablement capabilities (59 tech requirements, 89% TPAY). He is the **2nd highest contributor** on the BO/PO team (after Metin's 100) and creates **2.5x more issues than peer Bilal**. However, his **very low BPAY activity (11%)** indicates **weak business stakeholder engagement**, which is a critical PO responsibility Gap.

**Key Strength:** Developer champion - 59 TPAY issues enables team effectively

**Key Weakness:** Business stakeholder gap - Only 7 BPAY issues (11%)

**Critical Recommendation:** Increase BPAY activity from 11% to 25-30% while maintaining tech output. Clarify role split with Bilal (recommend: Tahsin = Tech PO 75%, Bilal = Business PO 50%).

**2026 Priority:**
1. 2-3x BPAY activity (7 → 15-20 issues)
2. Maintain TPAY excellence (50-55 issues)
3. Collaborate with Bilal on role clarity
4. Track and improve requirement quality

**Manager Note:** Tahsin is a **proven technical PO** with strong developer enablement. His profile is ideal for a "Tech PO" role, but Payment team needs more business stakeholder coverage (currently only 17 BPAY total for entire team). Recommendation: Specialize Tahsin as "Tech PO" (75% TPAY) and Bilal as "Business PO" (50% BPAY), with explicit role definition and balanced workload (Tahsin 65-70, Bilal 50-60).
