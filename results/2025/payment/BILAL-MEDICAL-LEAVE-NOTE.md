## 💡 Recommendations (Revised)

### 2025 Assessment (Retrospective)

**Original Concern:** "Low output (26 issues) - workload imbalance?"

**Revised Assessment:** ✅ **Acceptable performance given medical challenges**
- Bilal maintained **3.25 issues/month** during active periods
- **Resilience demonstrated** - Continued working at near-standard rate despite health issues
- **Business focus maintained** - 38% BPAY even during difficult year

### 2026 Goals (Adjusted for Health Recovery)

**Assumptions:**
- Full health recovery (12 months active)
- Return to full capacity

**Targets:**
- **Total Issues:** 45-50 (not aggressive "double", just healthy growth)
- **Monthly Rate:** 3.75-4.2/month (modest 15-30% increase)
- **BPAY Focus:** 40-50% (20-25 business issues)
- **TPAY Support:** 50-60% (25-30 tech issues)

**Rationale:** Realistic growth from 3.25/mo → 4/mo, accounting for full year availability

## 📋 Manager Action Items

### Immediate (Q1 2026)

1. **✅ Recognize resilience** - Bilal maintained productivity during health challenges
2. **✅ Set realistic targets** - 45-50 issues (not "doubling" based on misleading 26/12 rate)
3. **✅ Support recovery** - Ensure full health before pushing for aggressive goals

### Performance Review Considerations

**When Discussing 2025:**
- ✅ **Mention medical context** - 2 months leave is significant
- ✅ **Use adjusted metrics** - 3.25/month, not 2.2/month
- ✅ **Highlight strengths** - Business board champion (38% BPAY, best on team)
- ❌ **Avoid unfair comparisons** - Don't compare 26 (8mo) vs. 66 (12mo) without context

**2026 Target Setting:**
- ✅ **Realistic growth** - 3.25/mo → 4/mo (15-25% increase)
- ✅ **Leverage business strength** - Specialize as Business PO (50% BPAY)
- ✅ **Document role split** - Bilal=Business, Tahsin=Tech (clear responsibilities)

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**Key Insight:** Bilal Cihangir's **apparent low output (26 issues)** is **misleading without medical leave context**. When adjusted for **8 active months**, his **3.25 issues/month** is **near industry standard** and demonstrates **professional resilience** during a challenging health year.

**Grade Revision:** C+ → B+ (71/100 → 82/100)

**2026 Outlook:** ⭐ **POSITIVE** - With full health recovery, Bilal is on track for 45-50 issues maintaining his unique business stakeholder strength (38-50% BPAY focus).
