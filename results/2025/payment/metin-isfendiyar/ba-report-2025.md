**Current State:**
- 77% of issues "Poor" detail quality
- 32-word average description (industry: 150-300)
- Only 5% "Good" or better

**Impact:**
- Developers can't pick up tasks without clarification

**Actions Required:**

  - So that [benefit]
  - Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
  - Technical context
  - Edge cases
  - Definition of Done
- [ ] **Stop creating:** Issues without description
- [ ] **Quality gate:** All issues must pass checklist before creation

**Owner:** Metin + Team Lead
**Timeline:** Immediate (Q1 2026)
**Target:**
- Zero issues with empty descriptions by Feb 2026
- 60%+ "Good" detail by Q2 2026
- 150+ avg words per story by Q2 2026

---

#### 2. **Completion Rate Improvement** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- 56% completion (industry: 70-85%)
- 20% still in Backlog
- 18% Closed (vs Done)

**Impact:**
- Poor visibility into actual delivery
- Potential work abandonment
- Planning inaccuracy

**Actions Required:**

- [ ] Clear WIP limits
- [ ] Sprint commitment discipline

**Owner:** Metin
**Timeline:** Q1 2026
**Target:** 70%+ completion by Q2 2026

---

#### 3. **Bug Ratio Management** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- 17% of issues are Bugs (1,904 bugs!)
- Industry standard: <5% for BA-created issues

**Potential Causes:**
- BA creating bug tickets (should be QA/Dev)
- Unclear story requirements leading to bugs
- Post-release issues from poor acceptance criteria

**Actions Required:**
- [ ] Review bug creation process
- [ ] Should BA create bugs or just triage?
- [ ] Improve story quality to reduce bugs
- [ ] Better acceptance criteria

**Owner:** Metin + Product Manager
**Timeline:** Q1 2026

---

#### 4. **Test Issue Volume** 🤔

**Current State:**
- 1,120 Test issues (10% of total)
- Likely automated test creation

**Questions:**
- Are these manually created or auto-generated?
- Should BA be creating test cases?
- Is this QA's responsibility?

- [ ] Clarify BA vs QA responsibilities
- [ ] If automated, exclude from BA metrics
- [ ] Focus on story quality instead

**Owner:** Team Lead
**Timeline:** Q1 2026

---

#### 5. **Bulk Creation Pattern & Quality Impact** 🚨

**Current State:**
- 100% activity in Q4 (Oct-Dec)
- **Week 48:** 2,688 issues (537/day, 67/hour!)
- Quality degraded as volume increased: Oct (30.8) → Dec (18.2)
- Clear evidence of automated/bulk issue creation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- 67 issues/hour = automated process
- Quality inversely correlated with volume
- Suggests template-based or imported issues
- Follow-up enrichment never happened

**Impact:**
- 🚨 **Critical:** 2,016 issues created but never detailed
- Low completion (56%) due to unclear requirements
- Team can't work on issues without clarification
- Creates BA bottleneck (verbal explanation needed)
- Not sustainable for PO role

**Actions Required:**
- [ ] **Immediate:** Investigate if bulk creation was migration/import
- [ ] If migration: Backfill missing descriptions (prioritize by value)
- [ ] If templated: Improve template quality
- [ ] **New rule:** NO bulk creation without minimum quality standards
- [ ] Enrichment sprint: Add descriptions to top 200 backlog items
- [ ] Establish sustainable velocity (max 50-100 issues/week)

**Owner:** Metin + Manager + Team Lead
**Timeline:** Immediate (Jan 2026)
**Target:**
- Understand spike reason by end of Jan
- Backfill critical stories by end of Feb
