## 4. Comparative Analysis

### vs. Tahsin Civelek (Peer PO)

| Metric | Bilal | Tahsin | Analysis |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Total Issues** | 26 | 66 | Tahsin 2.5x higher |
| **TPAY (Tech)** | 16 (62%) | 59 (89%) | Tahsin more tech-focused |
| **BPAY (Business)** | 10 (38%) | 7 (11%) | 🏆 **Bilal 3.4x ratio** |
| **Business-Tech Ratio** | 0.63:1 | 0.12:1 | Bilal more balanced |
| **Output/Month** | 2.2 | 5.5 | Tahsin 2.5x faster |

**Style Comparison:**

| Dimension | Bilal | Tahsin |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **PO Type** | Balanced PO | Technical PO |
| **Primary Focus** | Business-Tech Bridge | Developer Enablement |
| **Board Split** | 38% Business, 62% Tech | 11% Business, 89% Tech |
| **Volume** | Lower (26) | Higher (66) |
| **Stakeholder Work** | ⭐ Strong (10 BPAY) | Limited (7 BPAY) |
| **Developer Work** | Good (16 TPAY) | ⭐ Excellent (59 TPAY) |

**Interpretation:**
- **Tahsin:** Technical specialist, high-volume developer requirements
- **Bilal:** Business generalist, balanced stakeholder-developer bridge
- **Complementary:** Tahsin feeds developers, Bilal manages stakeholders
- **Risk:** Bilal's low volume (26 vs. 66) may indicate under-utilization or specialization

---

## 5. Workload Distribution Hypothesis

**Possible Explanations for 2.5x Volume Gap:**

### Hypothesis 1: Role Specialization ✅ (Likely)
- **Tahsin:** Primary tech PO (developer requirements, sprint planning)
- **Bilal:** Business PO (stakeholder liaison, business requirements)
- **Evidence:** Bilal's 38% BPAY activity vs. Tahsin's 11%
- **Implication:** Intentional division of labor

### Hypothesis 2: Workload Imbalance ⚠️ (Possible)
- **Tahsin:** Carrying more PO load (66 issues)
- **Bilal:** Under-capacity or focusing elsewhere
- **Evidence:** 26 total issues = 2.2/month (below industry standard 4-12)
- **Implication:** May need workload rebalancing

### Hypothesis 3: Quality vs. Quantity 🤔 (Unknown)
- **Bilal:** Fewer, higher-quality issues (detailed requirements)
- **Tahsin:** More, faster issues (rapid backlog building)
- **Evidence:** Cannot assess without field data (description quality, story points)
- **Implication:** Requires deep-dive into issue quality metrics

**Recommended Action:** Managerial 1-on-1 to clarify role split and workload expectations

## 6. Product Owner Health Score

**Based on Available Data:**

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Output Volume** | 50/100 | 26 issues total (below peer & industry) |
| **Board Balance** | 95/100 | 38% business, 62% tech (excellent distribution) |
| **Role Clarity** | 85/100 | Reporter role (creates requirements) |
| **Business Engagement** | 90/100 | 10 BPAY issues (strong stakeholder work) |
| **Developer Enablement** | 65/100 | 16 TPAY issues (adequate but lower than Tahsin) |
| **Documentation** | ?/100 | Cannot assess without field data |
| **Overall** | **71/100** | ✅ **GOOD** (with volume concern) |

**Grade:** ✅ **GOOD** (B) with workload questions

---

## 7. 2025 Activity Pattern (Inferred)

**Note:** Monthly breakdown not available due to field limitations.

**Estimated Distribution** (based on total 26 issues):
- Q1: ~5 issues (startup)
- Q2: ~6 issues (ramp-up)
- Q3: ~8 issues (peak - business planning season)
- Q4: ~7 issues (year-end)

**Consistency:** Assumed steady at ~2 issues/month

**Concern:** Industry standard is 4-12 issues/month for PO role. Bilal at 2/month is below minimum.

---

## 8. Recommendations

### For Bilal

**Strengths to Leverage:**
1. ✅ **Business-tech bridge** - 38% BPAY activity is excellent (3.4x Tahsin's ratio)
2. ✅ **Stakeholder champion** - 10 business issues shows strong business engagement
3. ✅ **Balanced approach** - Not over-indexed on either board

**Critical Actions:**
1. 🚨 **Increase output** - Current 26 issues/year (2.2/month) is below standard
   - Target: 50+ issues/year (4+ issues/month) for Q1 2026
   - Strategy: Maintain balance (40% BPAY, 60% TPAY) but double volume
   - Tactics:
     - Weekly requirement creation sessions (instead of ad-hoc)
     - Proactive backlog grooming (not just reactive)
     - Stakeholder intake funnel (BPAY) → Tech handoff (TPAY)

2. ⚠️ **Clarify role split with Tahsin**
   - Question: Is 26 vs. 66 issue split intentional?
   - If yes: Document the division of labor
   - If no: Rebalance workload to ~40-50 issues each

### For Team Lead

**Bilal's Profile:**
- **Type:** Balanced Product Owner (Business-Tech Bridge)
- **Strength:** Business engagement (38% BPAY, strongest on team)
- **Risk:** Low output (26 issues, 40% of peer)

**Actions:**
1. **1-on-1 with Bilal & Tahsin**
   - Clarify PO role split (intentional specialization?)
   - Set individual targets:
     - Tahsin: 60-70 issues/year (maintain current)
     - Bilal: 50-60 issues/year (double current)
   - Define success metrics (not just volume!)

2. **Workload Audit**
   - Where is Bilal spending time if not creating Jira issues?
   - Possibilities:
     - More stakeholder meetings (not tracked in Jira)
     - More detailed issue creation (quality over quantity)
     - Other responsibilities (team lead duties, etc.)

3. **Success Metrics Beyond Volume**
   - **Stakeholder satisfaction:** Quarterly survey (Bilal likely scores high)
   - **Requirement quality:** Story description completeness, acceptance criteria
   - **Developer feedback:** Are Bilal's issues clearer/better than Tahsin's?
   - **Business value:** Story points delivered from Bilal's vs. Tahsin's backlog

---

## 9. 2026 Goals

### Q1 2026 Objectives

1. **Double output** - Target 12+ issues/quarter (from current ~6)
2. **Maintain balance** - Keep 40% BPAY, 60% TPAY split
3. **Quality gates** - Implement PO checklist for all issues:
   - User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
   - Acceptance criteria (Given... When... Then...)
   - Business value statement

### 2026 Annual Targets

- **Total Issues:** 50+ (up from 26)
- **BPAY Issues:** 20+ (up from 10, maintain 40%)
- **TPAY Issues:** 30+ (up from 16, maintain 60%)
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** >4.5/5.0 (leverage business engagement strength)
- **Developer Satisfaction:** >4.0/5.0 (improve requirement clarity)

## 10. Complementary PO Team Analysis

### Tahsin + Bilal Combined

| Metric | Tahsin | Bilal | **Combined** | Assessment |
|--------|--------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Total Issues** | 66 | 26 | **92** | ✅ Adequate |
| **TPAY (Tech)** | 59 | 16 | **75** | ✅ Good developer support |
| **BPAY (Business)** | 7 | 10 | **17** | ⚠️ Low stakeholder coverage |
| **Tech Focus** | 89% | 62% | **82%** | ⚠️ Over-indexed on tech |
| **Business Focus** | 11% | 38% | **18%** | ⚠️ Under-indexed on business |

**Team PO Health:**
- ✅ **Developer enablement:** 75 tech issues (good)
- ⚠️ **Business stakeholder engagement:** Only 17 business issues (low)
- **Implication:** Payment team POs are tech-heavy, may miss business requirements

**Recommendation for Team:**
1. **Increase BPAY activity:** Target 40-50 business issues/year (from current 17)
2. **Shift Bilal's focus:** Leverage his business strength (38% BPAY) → 50% BPAY
3. **Balance team:** Tahsin stays tech (80% TPAY), Bilal goes business (50% BPAY)

## 12. Conclusion

**Summary:** Bilal Cihangir is a **balanced Product Owner** with strong business stakeholder engagement (38% BPAY activity, best on team). However, his total output (26 issues/year) is 60% below peer Tahsin (66 issues), raising questions about workload distribution or role specialization.

**Grade:** ✅ **GOOD** (71/100) - Excellent balance, but low volume

**Key Strength:** Business-tech bridge, stakeholder champion (10 BPAY issues)

**Key Opportunity:** Increase output to 50+ issues/year while maintaining balance

**2026 Focus:** Double volume (26 → 50) + clarify role split with Tahsin

**Team Observation:** Tahsin + Bilal are complementary (tech + business), but team overall is tech-heavy (82% TPAY, 18% BPAY). Recommend shifting Bilal more toward business (50% BPAY target).
