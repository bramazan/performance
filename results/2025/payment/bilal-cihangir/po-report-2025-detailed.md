## 💡 Recommendations

### For Bilal

**⚕️ Medical Leave Context:**
- 2 months surgery recovery in 2025
- **Actual productivity:** 26 issues / 8 months = **3.25/month**
- **Adjusted assessment:** Near industry standard (not "low")

**Immediate Actions (Q1 2026):**

1. ✅ **Modest output increase (REVISED TARGET)**
   - 2025 Active: 26 issues / 8 months = 3.25/month
   - 2026 Target: 45-50 issues/year (3.75-4.2/month)
   - **NOT doubling** - Just 15-25% increase from active rate
   - Strategy:
     - Weekly requirement creation sessions (schedule 2h block)
     - Proactive backlog grooming (not just reactive)
     - Stakeholder intake funnel (BPAY) → 40%, Tech handoff (TPAY) → 60%

2. ✅ **Maintain business focus strength**
   - Current: 38% BPAY (best on team)
   - Target: Increase to 40-50% BPAY
   - Tactics:
     - Weekly business stakeholder sync (capture requirements)
     - Bilal owns BPAY board (Tahsin focuses TPAY)
     - Target: 20-25 BPAY issues/year (from current 10)

3. ⚠️ **Increase tech requirements**
   - Current: 16 TPAY issues
   - Target: 25-30 TPAY issues/year
   - Note: Don't sacrifice business strength, grow tech in parallel

**Growth Areas:**

1. **Output Volume (Critical)**
   - 26 issues/year is 40% of Tahsin (peer PO)
   - Industry minimum: 50 issues/year for full-time PO
   - Root cause analysis needed:
     - Are you doing non-Jira PO work? (meetings, verbal requirements)
     - Is workload split with Tahsin unclear?
     - Quality over quantity approach? (speculation)

2. **Quality Metrics (Unknown)**
   - Request full Jira field access to measure:
     - Description detail scores
     - Story point estimation
     - Acceptance criteria coverage
   - Hypothesis: Bilal may have higher quality issues (lower volume, better detail)

3. **Developer Enablement**
   - 16 TPAY issues = 27% of Tahsin's 59
   - Risk: Are developers getting enough requirements from Bilal?
   - Mitigation: Ensure Tahsin + Bilal combined coverage is adequate (currently 75 TPAY total = OK)

### For Team Lead / Manager

**Bilal's Profile:**
- **Type:** Business-Focused Balanced PO
- **Strength:** Stakeholder champion (38% BPAY, best on team)
- **Risk:** Low output (26 vs. 66 peer) - 60% below expectation

**Critical Questions to Answer:**

1. **Role Clarity:**
   - Is Bilal + Tahsin split intentional?
   - Expected ratio: 50:50 output or 40:60?
   - Current: 28:72 (Bilal:Tahsin)

2. **Workload Audit:**
   - Where is Bilal spending time if not creating Jira issues?
   - Possibilities:
     - More stakeholder face-time (meetings, not tracked in Jira)
     - Higher quality issues (fewer but detailed)
     - Other responsibilities (team coaching, process improvement)
     - Under-capacity or under-utilized

3. **Role Specialization:**
   - **Option A:** Intentional - Bilal = Business PO (stakeholders), Tahsin = Tech PO (developers)
   - **Option B:** Accidental - Workload imbalance needs rebalancing
   - **Recommendation:** Clarify in 1-on-1

**Action Items:**

1. **1-on-1 with Bilal** (This Quarter)
   - Discuss output gap (26 vs. 66)
   - Clarify role expectations
   - Set individual targets (50+ issues for 2026)

2. **1-on-1 with Tahsin + Bilal Together**
   - Define PO role split
   - Agree on targets:
     - Tahsin: 60-70/year (maintain current)
     - Bilal: 50-60/year (double current)
   - Clarify board ownership:
     - Bilal leads BPAY (business)
     - Tahsin leads TPAY (tech)

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Request Jira field access
   - Compare Bilal vs. Tahsin issue quality
   - Hypothesis: Bilal may have fewer but higher quality issues
   - If true: Adjust expectations (quality over quantity)

4. **2026 Targets**
   - **Bilal's Goal:** 50 issues (20 BPAY + 30 TPAY)
   - **Team Goal:** 120 total PO issues (Bilal 50 + Tahsin 70)
   - **Balance Goal:** 30% BPAY, 70% TPAY (from current 18% BPAY)

## 🎖️ Final Assessment

**Overall Rating:** ⭐ **GOOD+** (82/100) - B+

**⚕️ CRITICAL CONTEXT: 2-Month Medical Leave**

Bilal Cihangir underwent **surgery in 2025 and was on medical leave for 2 months**. When adjusted for active work period:
- **Actual productivity:** 26 issues / 8 active months = **3.25 issues/month**
- **Industry standard:** 4-12 issues/month for PO
- **Assessment:** ✅ **Near standard** (81% of minimum, acceptable given recovery)

**Summary:** Bilal Cihangir is a **balanced, business-focused Product Owner** with exceptional stakeholder engagement (38% BPAY, best on team). His **apparent low output (26 issues/year)** is largely explained by **2-month medical leave**. When adjusted for active months, his **3.25 issues/month** is **near industry standard** and demonstrates **resilience** in maintaining productivity during a challenging health year.

**Key Strength:** Business board champion (10 BPAY issues, 3.4x Tahsin's ratio)

**Medical Leave Impact:** 2 months surgery (2025) reduced effective work time to 8 months

**Adjusted Assessment:** When medical leave is factored, Bilal's 3.25 issues/month is acceptable and **gap with Tahsin reduces to 41%** (from apparent 60%).

**Critical Insight:** **Medical leave + role specialization** explain the gap. Bilal is the **Business PO** (38% BPAY) while Tahsin is **Tech PO** (89% TPAY). This is likely intentional division of labor.

**2026 Priority:**
1. ✅ **Healthy recovery** - Return to full capacity (12 months active)
2. ✅ **Modest growth** - 45-50 issues (not "double", just 15-25% increase)
3. ✅ **Maintain business strength** - Keep 40-50% BPAY focus
4. ✅ **Clarify role split** - Document Bilal=Business, Tahsin=Tech

**Manager Note:**

⚕️ **Medical Leave Context (2025):** Bilal had **2-month surgery recovery**, reducing his effective work period to 8 months. This context is CRITICAL for fair assessment.

**Adjusted Performance:**
- Actual: 3.25 issues/month (8 active months)
- Annualized: ~39 issues/year equivalent
- Industry: 4-12/month (Bilal at 81% of minimum = acceptable given health challenges)

**Bilal's business engagement (38% BPAY) is a **unique strength** on the team. Recommendation:

✅ **Specialize Bilal as "Business PO"** with understanding of 2025 medical context:
- 2026 Target: 45-50 issues (not aggressive doubling, just modest 15-25% growth)
- BPAY Focus: 40-50% (20-25 business issues)
- TPAY Support: 50-60% (25-30 tech issues)
- **Realistic given health recovery + return to full capacity**
